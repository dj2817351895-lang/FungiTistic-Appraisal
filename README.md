# FungiTistic-Appraisal
HMF-Net is a hypergraph-based multi-modal framework for fine-grained fungal species recognition. It integrates RGB images, morphology features, satellite imagery, and metadata into a shared space, and models high-order sample relationships via data-driven hypergraphs to capture group-level semantic similarity in complex, long-tailed scenarios.
